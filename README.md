# The Weather Dashboard

## Description

A simple weather dashboard where a user can search any city and see the average weather for 6 days based on datapoints for every three hours. 

The user search history is saved for easy access the next time they visit the website. 

This site uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this project I learned a lot about fetching API's, storing the data in local storage, and displaying that data to the DOM. I used a lot of arrays and object arrays to achieve this and learned a lot about storing and accessing data. 

Further, I learned how to loop through arrays, and how to break down user input so I could capitalize selected letters before using Javascript.
